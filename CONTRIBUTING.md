## Pull Requests

The preferred way to contribute is to fork the
[main repository](https://gitee.com/anji-plus/captcha) on Gitee.

1. Fork the [main repository](https://gitee.com/anji-plus/captcha).  Click on the 'Fork' button near the top of the page.  This creates a copy of the code under your account on the Gitee.

2. Clone this copy to your local disk:

        $ git clone git@gitee.com:%YourLogin%/captcha.git
        $ cd captcha

3. Create a branch to hold your changes and start making changes. 
   
   !!!!Note:: Don't work in the `master` branch!

        $ git checkout -b my-feature

4. Work on this copy on your computer using Git to do the version control. When you're done editing, run the following to record your changes in Git:

        $ git add modified_files
        $ git commit

5. Push your changes to Gitee with:

        $ git push -u origin my-feature

6. Finally, go to the web page of your fork of the `captcha` repo and click 'Pull Request' to send your changes for review.

7. If you want to update your pull request, just commit your changes to your branch and push to your fork.

8. ***important***: By submitting a patch, you agree to allow the project owners to license your work under the terms of the [Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/anji-plus/captcha/blob/master/LICENSE).

9. REMEMBER:  submitting PR to branch anji-plus:dev instead of anji-plus:master.
